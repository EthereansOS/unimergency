                        <p>Weâ€™ve decided on a simple experimental voting system for this challenge, one that uses buidl.</p>
                    </section>
                    <h2>Rules:</h2>
                    <section className="ExpPar">
                        <p>buidl holders will be able to vote by staking their buidl until the end of the challenge (with no benefits for early voters). 1 Vote = 1,000 buidl Voters are disincentivized from double voting by a vote tax of 10 buidl (by burn).</p>

                    <section className="ExpPar">
                        <p>What this means is that buidl holders can vote more than once, but it will cost them 10 buidl each time.</p>
                    </section>
                    <h2>Why this experiment?</h2>
                    <section className="ExpPar">
                        <p>Among decentralized voting systems, there is an unresolved debate. Stake voting, Democratic Voting and Quadratic Voting all offer compelling arguments with different pros and cons.</p>
                    </section>
                    <section className="ExpPar">
                        <p>DFOhub aims to experiment with a variety of different and exotic voting systems. For this contest, we are trying a very simple fusion of Stake + Democratic + Quadratic Voting that incentivizes long term buidl holders to vote, while reducing whale voting as much as possible. If a whale really wants to vote more, he or she benefits all other holders by deflating the buidl supply.</p>

                    <h2>How to vote?</h2>
                    <section className="ExpPar">
                        <p>buidl holder can vote via the "Vote" section, by clicking "Approve", wait for the Approve Transaction and then by clicking to "Vote"</p>
                        <p>All of the buidl staked to vote are redeemable after the Contest end block via the button "Redeem"</p>
